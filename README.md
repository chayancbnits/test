**A couple things to keep in mind:**

 - If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
 - Keep the code style (indents, wrapping) consistent.
 - If your PR involves a lot of commits, squash them using ```git rebase -i``` as this makes it easier for us to review.
 - Keep lines under 80 characters.
